# Clock-Project
A clock made with SVG tag and tried new things, some design with CSS. Tried something new.

It's a clock don't work but the design of it looks cool.
Dark background and shades.

Used SVG tag to make this clock. As I can use normal css to design clock but I tried something and I think it's not that but loved it a lot as now-a-days dark theme are in use so thought of it and worked with it. Tried my best to design it.

I'll soon use JavaScript as I am learning now so, wait a while and let's see something new.
